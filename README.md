# Ipecho

Simple "what's my ip/host" service I wrote to host on one of my nodes, simply because I never remember the url to services like there, while I remember `ip.` subdomain of my own main domain.

### Example

```
λ fenrir ~ → curl ip.absalon.is
178.62.35.194
λ fenrir ~ → curl ip.absalon.is/host
absalon.is
```
